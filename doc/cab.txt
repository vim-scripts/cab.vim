ONLY FOR MAC

Cab is a Vim plugin for using ack-grep (http://betterthangrep.com) in
common with iterm (http://www.iterm2.com/) for fast and easy search in
a project from vim.
It uses current working directory as a root.
It's possible to use Cab only with iterm (not with terminal) bacause cab
uses applescript API for interaction with iterm (or iterm2).

How to use Cab:

  in the main mode:
    place the cursor on the word to search and press <Leader>f
    it will open new tab of the iterm and run the coommand "ack -Q <word for search>"

  in the visual mode:
    select a range of text to search and press <Leader>f
    it will open new tab of the iterm and run the coommand "ack -Q <text for search>"

  in the command mode:
    type :Cab <text for search>
    it will open new tab of the iterm and run the coommand "ack -Q <text for search>"

Cab automatically escape special symbols and quotes. You can search for
any text. For exaple
 :Cab Search for this "quoted" 'text' and /\ slashes

You can redefine a method of invoking ack using global variable cab_ack_cmd
Example (write it in the your ~/.vimrc file):

  let g:cab_ack_cmd = "ack-grep -irn --ignore-dir=assets"
